# Diabetes-Disease-Progression-A-Statistical-Analysis.
##Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects a significant portion of the world's population and has a significant impact on public health. The aim of this study is to predict the progression of diabetes using quantitative measures one year after baseline.

##Objective

The objective of this study is to predict the progression of diabetes using two statistical models: linear regression and multiple regression. The independent variables used in the analysis include age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

##Methodology

The first step in this study was to assess the correlations between the independent variables. This was done using a scatter plot. After that, the linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between BMI and disease progression and to test the hypothesis that no such relationship exists.

The multiple regression model was employed when multiple variables were believed to influence the dependent variable. The aim was to determine which variables significantly affect the dependent variable and which do not. The model was evaluated for its performance, and if found to be adequate, the independent variables were plugged into the regression formula to predict the dependent variable.

##Results

The results of this study showed that the linear regression model was adequate in examining the relationship between BMI and disease progression. The hypothesis that no such relationship exists was either rejected or failed to be rejected based on the evaluation of various performance measures and statistical results.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, this study aimed to predict the progression of diabetes using linear and multiple regression models and to examine the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence the progression of diabetes.

The multiple regression model was also adequate in determining which variables significantly affect the dependent variable and which do not. The results showed that the variables age, sex, and BMI significantly affect the progression of diabetes.
